# Ripple + Resilience, in a very simple true peer-to-peer implementation

Uses UDP, single-threaded server, a standardized datagram format for both client and server. Any data stored in alphanumeric format in text files. Accounts are identified by a username, and, the address of their host server (IP address or domain name). "Database" managed with simple directories, `datadir/resilience/accounts/username/peers/server_address/username`. No encryption, only authentication (as eavesdropping can happen in daily life too. ) Client can be "hidden" behind plug-in asymmeteric client by using `LocalClientMode`, to prevent anyone from accessing the getter functions. Otherwise all data is public to anyone who bothers to read from it. Counters (nonces) to prevent replay attacks. Retransmission and verification that payment succeeded and such can be added manually via client, this repository is the server only.
